            <p>Danielle's Dairy has been producing fresh quality dairy products since 1901, making       us the inter-mountain regionâ€™s
                oldest and largest full-service dairy company. Today we meet all the fresh dairy needs of our customers by
                providing everything from fluid milk and its by-products, such as cream, sour cream, butter and cottage cheese
                to a complete line of ice cream and frozen novelty items. We believe in being a good neighbor and in giving
                back to the people we serve through philanthropy and community involvement. We also provide financial and
                in-kind support to a number of organizations that strive to promote a message of health and nutrition to
                the local community.
