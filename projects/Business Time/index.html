            <h2>Who we are...</h2>
            <p>Danielle's Dairy has been producing fresh quality dairy products since 1901, making us the inter-mountain regionâ€™s oldest and largest full-service dairy company. Today we meet all the fresh dairy needs of our customers by providing everything from fluid milk and its by-products, such as cream, sour cream, butter and cottage cheese to a complete line of ice cream and frozen novelty items.</p>
            <p>We believe in being a good neighbor and in giving back to the people we serve through philanthropy and community involvement. We also provide financial and in-kind support to a number of organizations that strive to promote a message of health and nutrition to the local community.</p>
