## Mom's Shopping List
Your mom is frustrated by her propensity to lose slips of paper with writing on them, specifically her shopping lists. She knows that you're a really smart web developer and assumes that you can easily make her a website to keep track of her shopping list.

Project Requirements
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and optionally jQuery), write a simple shopping list app. There must be an input box to add new items, and an [x] button to delete items. The data does not have to persist a page refresh (because there's no API right now).

You should be able to delete items by clicking the [x]: 
delete
