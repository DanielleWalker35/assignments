        <h2>Just Walk Away</h2>
        <p>They are cute. They are fluffy
            <span id="mostly">(mostly)</span>. They are great fun and make perfect family pets. Right? Well, not entirely. With Christmas fast
            approaching, and despite campaigns urging people to be more cautious, many are still buying puppies as presents.
            Last year, it was reported that the Dogs Trust saw a 54% increase (on 2016) in the number of dogs abandoned at
            their shelters around Christmas.Presents don’t get any better than a puppy if you’re purely wanting the “ahhh”
            factor. But let’s just take a minute to look at the realities of getting a dog – after all, the “ahhh” moment
            only lasts until they have a wee on your new woollen rug. At that point, the reality may start sinking in. Dogs
            are amazing, but they require time, patience and dedication –
            <span id="important"> to mention a lifestyle change.</span>
        </p>
        <p>They are also
            <mark>expensive</mark> – not just a little, but a lot. While puppies are, admittedly cheaper than children, the average
            owner still spends between £21,000 and £33,000 on their dog during its lifetime and an enormous 98% of people
            underestimate this cost.

        <p>First, you have food bills – and you owe it to your dog to feed them a decent diet. In fact, if you need convincing,
            the better the food, the less poop they produce. Then there are veterinary bills and insurance costs. Even if
            you don’t get them insured for veterinary fees, you probably want to look at third-party liability – in the eyes
            of the law you are totally liable for your dog’s actions. And then there’s the costs of care when you go away
            on holiday.</p>
