            <p className="puppyPara">Puppy Playmates is an initiative led by Best Friends Animal Society that brings together passionate individuals, city shelters, and an entire coalition of animal welfare organizations to end the killing of dogs and cats in shelters throughout the entire state of Utah by the year 2019. Our plan is straightforward: provide spay/neuter services where they are needed most so that fewer animals go into shelters, and increase adoptions so that more animals are placed into new homes. Step by critical step, we believe that together, we can bring the number of pets killed in Utah shelters to zero. </p>
